## Description
The goal with this project was to start with a small amount of html and css, then add to the html and design a javascript file. This was to create a daily schedule planner that can be adjusted and the info on the page would be there when refreshed using local storage and event listeners. Also using web APIs to get info like current time and shorthand abilities for the page with jquery.
The only tools available were past lectures and resources and (extensive) help from the Teacher, TA's, and also classmates were a huge help! I also had help from a tutor with this project to smooth out the rough edges I was facing.
The reason for making this project was to challenge what I can do with javascript and the web APIs as tools for success. Also to have the ability to schedule a daily plan by the hour.
I learned with this project that the best way to get a project done is to psuedocode with comments to have steps to view in order to reach the goal of the project. I also learned that other perspectives on an issue are a good way to understand the code.

## Credits
